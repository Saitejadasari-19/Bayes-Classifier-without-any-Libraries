# Bayes Classifier from Scratch using Python Numpys and Matplotlib

## Datasets

Dataset 1: Linearly separable classes: 3 classes, 2-dimensional linearly separable data is
given. Each class has 500 data points.

Dataset 2: Nonlinearly separable classes: 2-dimensional data of 2 or 3 classes that are
nonlinearly separable. The number of examples in each class and their order is given at the
beginning of each file.

Dataset 3: Real-world data (Vowel data): 2-dimensional data of 3. The real-world data set
corresponds to the formant frequencies F1 and F2 for vowel utterances.

## Classifiers to be built for each dataset: Bayes classifier

1. Covariance matrix for all the classes is the same and is σ2I.
   
    a. You can obtain the same covariance matrix for all the classes by taking the average of
    covariance matrix of all the classes. You can obtain the same variance by averaging all
    the variances.
   
2. Full Covariance matrix for all the classes is the same and is Σ.
   
    a. You can obtain the same covariance matrix for all the classes by taking the average of
    covariance matrix of all the classes.
   
3. Covariance matric is diagonal and is different for each class.
 
4. Full covariance matrix for each class is different.
